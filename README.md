# Week4 Activity 2

## Exercise one

Using Figure 10.1 (Links to an external site.) in the Algorithms textbook as a model, illustrate the result of each of the operations PUSH(S, 4), PUSH(S, 1), PUSH(S, 3), POP(S), PUSH(S, 8), and POP(S) on an initially empty stack S stored in array S [1 . . 6].

## Exercise two

Using Figure 10.2 (Links to an external site.) in the Algorithms textbook as a model, illustrate the result of each of the operations ENQUEUE(Q, 4), ENQUEUE(Q, 1), ENQUEUE(Q, 3), DEQUEUE(Q), ENQUEUE(Q, 8), and DEQUEUE(Q) on an initially empty queue Q stored in array Q [1 . . 6].

## Exercise three

Write a queue operation Front (Q) using pseudo-code conventions. The Front operation returns the element at the front without removing it. You should consider underflow exceptions.

## Exercise four (challenge)

Write the ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE algorithms using pseudo-code conventions to detect underflow and overflow of a queue.#
